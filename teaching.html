    I am extremely enthusiastic about teaching, which is an important component of my academic career. As an educator, I strive to engage, challenge, and inspire my students to think about their world in new ways and with a scientific perspective. My goal is to both teach my students the traditional materials found in a textbook, and provide them with important skills, such as scientific reasoning, critical thinking and problem solving, which are essential for any career they choose to pursue. I find it very rewarding and satisfying by teaching, advising students, and growing with my students. <br><br>
    
    The following comments are from my previous students on the final course evaluation forms. These words make me feel rewarded, and strongly encourage me to improve myself to be a better educator! <br><br><br>
    CHEM 111/112 General Chemistry<br><br>
    <i>"
>>	The best part of the class was the willingness to help, no matter the issue from Dr. Ma. Whatever the case was, he was always willing to give any kind of help that he could offer. <br><br>
>>	Dr. Ma was a GREAT instructor.  He really has a passion for the subject and genuinely wants to help his students succeed! 	<br>	<br>
>>	Dr. Ma's dedication and passion in our class		<br><br>
>>	How enthusiastic Dr. Ma was and how much he knew about the subject. He is very helpful when I needed it the most.	<br><br>	
>>	The teacher was amazing! For a while I was confused by pretty much everything but once I got the hang of his teaching style then I was set. I began to think that all the learning objectives were too easy, when in fact, I actually just knew how to do them. He showed me what I deemed as a pointless and boring class to be an enjoyable and interesting educational opportunity not just about chemistry but about life as well. THANK YOU!<br><br>
>>	I liked the learning and extra credit opportunities that Dr. Ma gave to us. He clearly wanted the class to not only perform well and receive a passing grade, but to be able to apply the concepts to whatever major they pursue.<br><br>
>>	Awesome teacher: He put a lot of effort so students could understand class material. He was happy all the time bringing good vibes for the class. 		<br><br>
>>	I enjoyed this class. The material was sufficient and took my previous level chemistry classes to the next level. I also appreciate how willing Dr. Ma was in helping the students. There was never a time I felt as though I couldn't ask him a question. I could even stop and ask him if I saw him walking in the hallway.		<br><br>
>>	Dr. Xiang was very eager to engage the students with both the material covered in class as well as with current scientific studies. He repeatedly expressed his support of us and clearly wants us to succeed."<br><br>
>> I came into Grand View as a biochemistry major. I was super nervous about it, but Dr. Ma made the experience unforgettable. He was so helpful when I had questions or needed clarification on a subject. He never put anyone down. He gave me an even bigger love for chemistry than I had when I first walked in, and I am so grateful to have had him as a teacher.<br><br>
>> I was not excited to learn from Dr. Ma at first, but now at the end of the semester, I am very glad to have been a student in his class. I have evolved as a chemist and student from taking his lab class.

 >> Best professor ever! Fun and entertaining while teaching. Made chemistry interesting.<br><br>
 >> Great instructor, also really enjoyed the class. Dr. Ma made chem less scary. <br><br>
 >> Dr. Ma did an exceptional job with teaching this course. I learned more about chemistry than I could have imagined. Thank you! <br><br>
 >> Dr. Ma was excellent with lectures and organization. He has a unique way of presenting information & compared abstract concepts to reality.<br><br>
 >> Very informative course. Great professor with a passion for chem.<br><br>
 >> Definitely my favorite professor here. A great person and a great teacher. I hope to take another course from Professor Ma.
